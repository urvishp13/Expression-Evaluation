# Expression Evaluation

This project is solely written in Java. Please run it using Java 8.

## Overview

This project was an assignment given to Rutgers CS112 students in the Fall of 2014. It was redone in August 2021 with no recollection
of how the project was initially completed. The focus of this project is to evaluate algrebraic expresssions with variables/arrays with 
integer values and numeric expressions with integer constants ONLY. The expressions were to be solved using Stacks and Recursion.

## Code & Test Cases

The code written can be found in the [src](https://github.com/urvishp13/Expression-Evaluation/tree/main/src) folder. Look for the 
`@author Urvish Patel` tag before Classes to see the code I have written.
The code was tested using self-generated test cases that can be found in [this](insert link) file. Expressions are generated by the person
executing the program when prompted in the (eg. terminal). When creating expressions, only use variables/arrays that are in
the text file that contains the values for all your variables/arrays--this text file is basically like a database; 
if variables/arrays other than the ones listed are used, you will
get an evaluation but it will be incorrect (just a note if you're trying to test an edge case). If you want to create your own database with
variables/arrays and values of your choice, simply create a text file and follow the the instructions on 
how to format the content under the "Running the evaluator" section in [problem_specs](https://github.com/urvishp13/Expression-Evaluation/blob/main/docs/problem_specs.pdf)) 
file. The files for the databases I used are in the [data](https://github.com/urvishp13/Expression-Evaluation/tree/main/data) folder. 

## How to Test

To test the program, access the contents of this repository as appropriate for you and follow the instructions presented to you in the 
(eg. command line, console in Eclipse, etc.). 

If running the program using the command line, go into the `bin` 
folder of this repo and type `java apps.Evaluator`--as the .class files are already there.

To access the database files (.txt files) when running the program, you will have to backout/follow-directory-paths until you are 
in the directory of that file (eg. in the command line, you'll have to use `../data/<file_name>.txt`; in Eclipse, you'll have to use 
`data/<file_name>.txt`, etc.).
